**Reaktion** is an audio reactive animation toolkit for Unity.

[Demo](https://vine.co/v/h2H5Iqi3e3V)

It provides several components for reacting to audio signals.

- **Reaktor** processes audio signals and
  provides information to other components.

- **Reaktor To Transform** controls a Transform component
  with information from a Reaktor.

- **Reaktor To ParticleSystem** controls a Particle System component
  with information from a Reaktor.

- **Reaktor To Animator** controls an Animator component
  with information from a Reaktor.

- **Reaktor To Message** sends messages to Game Objects
  with information from a Reaktor.

System Requirements
-------------------

- Mac OS X
- Unity Pro

Setting Up
----------

1. Download [the package]
   (http://keijiro.github.io/Reaktion/reaktion-0.5.unitypackage)
   and import it to a project.

2. Create a game object and add *AudioJack* script component to it.
   For the detailed information about AudioJack, read [the documentation]
   (https://github.com/keijiro/AudioJack).

3. Add Reaktor and controller components (*Reaktor To XXX*) to game objects.
   Controllers automatically search a Reaktor that is the closest to it.

Reaktor Component
-----------------

![Reaktor](http://keijiro.github.io/Reaktion/inspector-reaktor.png)

Basically the *Reaktor* component is a kind of audio level meter with an
adaptive level detection algorithm. It allows controllers to react to a wide
range of audio signals without requiring detailed calibrations.

The Reaktor component has several options below.

#### Audio Source

It supports two types of audio sources -- *RMS Level* and *Frequency Band*.
If the controller needs to react to the audio level of a specific channel,
use *RMS Level*. If it needs to react to the level of a specific frequency
band (which is provided from the frequency spectrum analyzer in AudioJack),
use *Frequency Band*.

#### Curve

The *Curve* option gives a response curve to the output from the Reacktor.

#### Gain Control

The Reaktor supports external MIDI controllers. In *Gain Control* option,
it allows to assign a MIDI CC value to the gain of the output from the Reaktor.

#### Offset Control

The *Offset Control* option is another way to control the Reaktor with
external MIDI controllers. It offsets the output with a MIDI CC value
(i.e. simply adds the CC value to the output value).

#### Sensitivity

The *Sensitivity* option determines the strength of the output low-pass filter
in the Reaktor. The lower the value is set, the smoother and slower it reacts.
The filter can be disabled when the value is set to 1.

#### Audio Input Options

These options control the adaptive level detection algorithm.

- *Headroom* [dB] - gives a headroom to the dynamic range window.
- *Dynamic Range* [dB] - the width of the dynamic range window.
- *Lower Bound* [dB] - the window can move down to this level.
- *Falldown* [dB/Sec] - the fall-down speed of the window.

Reaktor To Transform Component
------------------------------

![ReaktorToTransform]
(http://keijiro.github.io/Reaktion/inspector-transform.png)

The *Reaktor To Transform* component assigns the output value from a Reaktor to
the position/rotation/scaling of a game object.

- *Translation* - moves the object along the *Vector*.
  The length of the *Vector* determines the amount of movement.
- *Rotation* - rotates the object around the *Axis*
  from *Min Angle* to *Max Angle* (angles are given in degree).
- *Scaling* - scales the object along the *Vector*.
  The length of the *Vector* determines the amount of scaling.

Reaktor To ParticleSystem Component
-----------------------------------

![ReaktorToParticleSystem]
(http://keijiro.github.io/Reaktion/inspector-particle.png)

The *Reaktor To ParticleSystem* component assigns the output value from
a Reaktor to emission parameters in a particle system.

#### Burst

When the Reaktor output exceeds the *Threshold*, it emits a number of
particles specified in the *Particles* option. The *Interval* value determines
the minimum interval between two consecutive bursts.

#### Emission Rate

It assigns the Reaktor output to the emission rate of the particle system.
The *Max Rate* gives the maximum emission rate when the Reaktor output
reaches 1.0 (100%). The *Rate Curve* gives a response curve between
the Reaktor output and the emission rate.

Reaktor To Animator Component
-----------------------------

![ReaktorToAnimator]
(http://keijiro.github.io/Reaktion/inspector-animator.png)

The *Reaktor To Animator* component assigns the output value from a Reaktor
to the playback speed of an Animator, or sends triggers to an animation
controller.

Reaktor To Message Component
----------------------------

![ReaktorToMessage]
(http://keijiro.github.io/Reaktion/inspector-message.png)

The *Reaktor To Message* component sends messages to a game object with
*MonoBehaviour.SendMessage* method.

If a game object is given in the *Send To* option, it sends messages to the
given object. If the option is left *None*, it sends messages to itself.

Receiver functions must be implemented as follows:

    void OnReaktorTrigger ();
    void OnReaktorInput (float level);

The names of the receiver functions can be changed with the *Message* options.

Making custom controllers
-------------------------

You can make your own custom controller in a few steps.

#### Searching a Reaktor

You can use *SearchAvailableFrom* function to get a reference to the closest
Reaktor component from a game object.

    Reaktor reaktor;
   
    void Start() {
        reaktor = Reaktor.SearchAvailableFrom(gameObject);
    }

#### Getting the Reaktor output

You can get the output from the Reaktor with the *Output* property.

    void Update() {
        Debug.Log(“Output = ” + reaktor.Output);
    }

Basically that’s all!
