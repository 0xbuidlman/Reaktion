*Reaktion* is an audio reactive animation toolkit for Unity.

[Demo](https://vine.co/v/h2H5Iqi3e3V)

It provides several components for reacting to audio signals.

- *Reaktor* - processes audio signals and provides information to other components.
- *ReaktorToTransform* - controls Transform with information from a Reaktor.
- *ReaktorToParticleSystem* - controls ParticleSystem with information from a Reaktor.
- *ReaktorToAnimator* - controls Animator with information from a Reaktor.
- *ReaktorToMessage* - sends messages with information from a Reaktor.

Reaktor Component
-----------------

The *Reaktor* component is a kind of audio level meter that processes audio
signals and provides the level information to other components. It uses an
adaptive level detection algorithm to process wide range of input signals,
and it allows apps to receive several types of signals without calibrations.
